## Introduction

### Data Science for Social Good at Imperial College London

The Data Science for Social Good Fellowship is a summer program to train aspiring data scientists to work on data mining, machine learning, big data, and data science projects with social impact. Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows take on real-world problems in education, health, energy, public safety, transportation, economic development, international development, and more.

For three months they learn, hone, and apply their data science, analytical, and coding skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere, and learn from mentors coming from industry and academia.

### Partners

The project was done in collaboration with the CIBERCV (Biomedical Research Networking Centres - Cardiovascular) research team working at the Hospital Universitario de Salamanca (USAL). USAL has one of the most advanced cardiographic imaging units in Spain and serves an ageing, largely rural population. The team of cardiologists at USAL is investigating new technologies such as artificial intelligence to help improve patient care.

## Overview

The processing pipeline is structured as follows.

## Infrastructure requirements
We retrieve our data from an AWS S3 bucket and use an AWS EC2 server for running all code. Results for each processing layer are stored in an AWS RDS.
